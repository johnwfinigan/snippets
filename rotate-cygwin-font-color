# Add this to your .bash_profile
# each time you start Cygwin mintty, color settings are rewritten to change the color
# of your font *for next mintty start*, such that on average, each window you start has
# a different font color than the last.

# Remember, the trick here is that mintty is a windows native program, so it starts
# BEFORE any of the unix tools are availaible.

# RGB 155 as a constant provides a decent level of brightness for a black background
# Font colors will on average be saturated pastels.
